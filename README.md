# Tero Bot

I'm building this bot while teaching software engineering on [Skillquest](https://skillquest.io)

## Notes on improvements
- Can't shoot well if it's close to the ball (often goes wide of net when it's scorable)
- When the ball is bouncing, it still gets right under the ball and then has to back off
- Powerslide turning is slow!
- Needs to stop retreating once it's at a certain spot on defense
- Could do simple net defense by parking in the right spot
- Simple prediction of whether or not the ball is scorable could help on offense and defense
